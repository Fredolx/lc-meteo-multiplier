## v1.1.2
- Fix softlock when attempting to land ship on planets with custom weather (thanks to YoshiWalsh for the contribution!)
## v1.1.1
- Default value multiply rates were too high. Vanilla is 0.4 and not 1. I strongly suggest deleting your configs and letting the mod re-create it for a more vanilla-like experience. It's now accurately set to +10% (dustclouds, foggy, rainy), +30% (stormy), +40% (flooded), +50% (eclipse) instead of +175% (dustclouds, foggy, rainy), +225% (stormy), +250% (flooded), +275% (eclipse) 
## v1.1.0
- Added spawn multipliers (amount of scrap spawned)
- Added apparatus multiplier option (on by default)
- Added toggle in config for mutipliers and spawn multipliers
## v1.0.1
- Small typo fix
